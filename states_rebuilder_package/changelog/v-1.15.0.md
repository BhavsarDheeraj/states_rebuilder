## `Inject.previous` Constructor

With the named constructor `Inject.previous`, you can inject and reinject objects by keeping track of their previous values before reinjection. `Inject.previous` is very useful when combined with the `reinjectOn` parameter.

Let's say we are in a shopping app, where a list of products will be displayed based on the authenticated user.

Our basic app will have an `Auth` class and a `Products` class. The `Products` class depends on the Auth class.

To inject the Products 

```dart
 return Injector(
    inject: [
        //Injecting the Auth object
        Inject(()=>Auth()),
        Inject.previous(
            (Products previous) => Products(
                //used to fetch data in the Products object
                token: Injector.get<Auth>().token,
                // authenticated user ID
                userId: Injector.get<Auth>().userId,
                //List of all items we want to keep from the previous Products object
                items: previous.items ?? [], 
                //We can establish more then one dependence
                otherProperty: Injector.get<OtherModel>().otherProperty,
            ),
        ),
    ],
    //Here the connection between Products and Auth objects is established
    //Whenever authRM emits a notification, the injected Products instance  
    //is override by a new one as defined in the Inject.previous constructor.
    reinjectOn: [RM.get<Auth>(), RM.get<OtherModel>()],
    //shouldNotifyOnReinjectOn:true, //this is the default behavior
    builder: (_) => ....

 )
```
>`reinjectOn` takes a list of `ReactiveModel`s, so theoretically you can link `Products` to an infinite number of objects

>By default the Products widget listeners will be notified when any of the models defined in the reinjectOn parameter issues a notification. To override this behavior set `shouldNotifyOnReinjectOn` parameter to false

## Shortcuts; reducing boilerplate

As you know, for each injected model there are two lazily registered singletons: the pure object instance and the reactive one:

To consume the pure registered instance we use `Injector.get<T>()`. 
From this update on there is a shortcut to it:  `IN.get<T>()`; IN stands for Injector

For the ReactiveModel, we used to use:

* `Injector.getAsReactive<T>()` or `ReactiveModel<T>()`, to get the ReactiveModel instance of type T
* `ReactiveModel<T>.create(myModel)` to create a local ReactiveModel
* `ReactiveModel<T>.future(myFuture)` to create a local future ReactiveModel.
* `ReactiveModel<T>.stream(myStream)` to create a local stream ReactiveModel.

Now as a Shortcuts:

* `RM.get<T>()`, to get the ReactiveModel instance of type T.
* `RM.create<T>(myModel)`, to create a local ReactiveModel.
* `RM.future<T>(myFuture)`, to create a local future ReactiveModel.
* `RM.stream<T>(myStream)`, to create a local stream ReactiveModel.

To notify widget observers, we use setState method;

If you are to get the ReactiveModel and call setState only once, you can use the new shortcut:
* `RM.getSetState<T>((s)=>s.method())`
this is a shortcut of :
* `RM.get<T>().setState((s)=>s.method())`

## Like `FutureBuilder` and `StreamBuilder` but more powerful:

Fluter core API has `FutureBuilder` and `StreamBuilder` to handle futures and streams respectively.

```dart
class Foo {
    Future<userID> login() async {
        await api.login(token);
    }
}
```
In the UI and after instantiating the Foo object using our dependence injection (Global instance, InheretedWidget, or Provider, get_it, ..), we use FutureBuilder

```dart
FutureBuilder(
    future : foo.login();
    builder : (context, snapshot){
        if(snapshot.isWaiting){
            return SplashScreen();
        }
        if(snapshot.hasError){
            return Text('An Error has happened'),
        }
        if(snapshot.hasData){
            return Text('${snapshot.data}');    
        }
    }
)
```

In states_rebuilder world, after injection the Foo object using Injector, use can use one of the availbale wdiget:
* `StateBuilder`, the default widget listener;
* `WhenRebuilder`, to exhaustively go throw all the available state status (onIdle, onWaiting, onError, onData);
* `WhenRebuilderOr`, to selectively go throw any of the available state status:
* `OnSetStateListener` to execute side effects.

### before this update:
```dart
WhenRebuilder<Foo>(
    models : [ReactiveModel<Foo>()],
    //we used the initState to trigger the future
    iniState : (ctx, fooRM) => fooRM.setState((s)=>s.login()),
    onIdle : ()=> Text('Welcoming Screen'),
    onWaiting : ()=> SplashScreen(),
    onError: (e)=> Text('An Error has happened'),
    onDate : (fooRM){
        return Text('${fooRM.state.userID}');
    }
)
```
Or; by creating a future ReactiveModel form the login method
```dart
WhenRebuilder<Foo>(
    models : [ReactiveModel.future<int>(Injector.get<Foo>().login())],
    onIdle : ()=> Text('Welcoming Screen'),
    onWaiting : ()=> SplashScreen(),
    onError: (e)=> Text('An Error has happened'),
    onData : (userIdRM){
      return Text('${userIdRM.value}');
    }
)
```
### after this update:

```dart
WhenRebuilder<Foo>(
    models : [RM.getFuture<Foo,int>((f)=> f.login())],
    onIdle : ()=> Text('Welcoming Screen'),
    onWaiting : ()=> SplashScreen(),
    onError: (e)=> Text('An Error has happened'),
    onData : (userId){
       return Text('${userIdRM}');
    }
)
```
in `RM.getFuture<Foo,int>((f)=> f.login())` the first generic type (Foo) defines the type of the injected model, and the second generic type (int) defined the resulting type of the value resolved by the future.

The same thing is obtained for stream using `RM.getStream`

```dart
WhenRebuilder<Foo>(
    models : [RM.getStream<Foo,int>((f)=> f.fireStoreStream())],
    onIdle : ()=> Text('Welcoming Screen'),
    onWaiting : ()=> SplashScreen(),
    onError: (error)=> Text('An Error has happened'),
    onData : (userId){
       return Text('${userId}');
    }
)
```

As I said you can use `StateBuilder`, `WhenRebuilderOr`, `OnSetStateListener`.
